SWATEM is an Android application that aims to streamline waste management efforts by centralizing the tracking of garbage levels in bins and mobilizing resources as needed. By accurately tracking the fill levels of garbage bins, resources can be efficiently allocated to pick up and dispose of the waste. This helps to reduce the environmental impact of waste and improve overall waste management practices.
