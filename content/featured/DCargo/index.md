Dcargo is a combination of hardware and web application which have been developed to monitor cargo containers in a more reliable and secure manner by storing backup data in IPFS using an Ethereum smart contract. This ensures that the data is preserved even in the event of a database failure, making the application failsafe. The application provides a secure and efficient way to track cargo containers.
